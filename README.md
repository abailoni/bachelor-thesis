## Resonances in quantum elastic scattering: a time-dependent numerical investigation
In my bachelor thesis, I investigate quantum scattering processes by numerically solving the time-dependent Schr Ìˆodinger equation, in the specific case of the hydrogen-krypton scattering. I discuss how scattering resonances are related to an increase of the probability, observed at some specific energies, of finding the scattered particle close to the interaction center.
